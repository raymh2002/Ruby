# A class is a the blueprint, pattern, template, or outline for an object

# An object is an instance of the class. It is created from the class.

# Instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class.

# A class is called an abstract type because it hides the complexity of interacting
# with the data, much like a method abstracts the complexity of a process.
